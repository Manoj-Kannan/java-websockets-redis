REDIS:
    Redis, which stands for REmote DIctionary Server, is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker.
    Redis primarily stores data in memory, which allows for extremely fast read and write operations.

    Versatile Data Structures
        Key-Value Store:
            Redis stores data as key-value pairs, where keys can be strings and values can be various data types (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, etc.).
        Advanced Data Types:
            It offers specialized data structures such as lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes, with atomic operations on these data structures.

    Session Store
        Redis can store session information such as user authentication tokens, preferences, and shopping cart contents.
        This allows the application to quickly retrieve and update session data, providing a seamless user experience across different requests and sessions.

    Pub/Sub Messaging
        Redis supports the Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging pattern, acting as a message broker for real-time communication and event-driven architectures.
        Publisher and Subscribers:
            Redis allows clients (publishers) to send messages to channels and other clients (subscribers) to receive messages from those channels.
        Asynchronous Messaging:
            Pub/Sub in Redis is asynchronous, meaning publishers and subscribers operate independently, enabling real-time data distribution without blocking operations.
        Channel-based Communication:
            Clients communicate through named channels, where publishers publish messages and subscribers receive messages from subscribed channels.
        Example:
            In a chat application, Redis Pub/Sub can be used to deliver chat messages in real-time to multiple users.
            Each chat room can be represented as a Redis channel, with users subscribing to channels they are interested in.
            When a user sends a message, Redis publishes it to the appropriate channel, and all subscribers receive the message instantly.

    Queues and Task Management
        Redis lists are commonly used to implement task queues and manage job processing efficiently across distributed systems.
        Example:
            Redis task queues can handle background job processing such as sending emails, processing payments, or generating reports.
            Workers (processing nodes) dequeue tasks from Redis queues, execute them, and update job states in Redis, ensuring reliable and scalable task management.

Distributed System:
    A distributed system is a network of independent computers that work together to provide a unified service, leveraging parallel processing, fault tolerance,
    and resource sharing across geographically dispersed nodes to achieve scalability and reliability in computing tasks.
